# Standard documentation

The reason for documentation standardisation is to allow all our software to be navigated easily.

All Argo software will need to have the following two documents:
- README.md
- LICENSE.md

Additional documentation can be added to software. This decision is up to the maintainers.

### README.md

This file should contain the following sections:

- Header
  - Title of the software
  - Software version badge
  - License badge
  - ROS2 Version badge
  - Project badge
- Installation guide
- User guide
- Additional hardware or software requirements (Optional per software)
- Any additional information required for proper use of software

Badges can be made using variety of different tools. My recommendation is [shields.io](https://shields.io/badges/).

### LICENSE.md

Contains the MIT License - Can be found in [3. Legal](https://github.com/Argo-Student-Robotics-Team/.github/tree/main/documentation/3.Legal.md)

## Installation guide

**Prerequisites:**
- Raspberry Pi 4+ (4GB+ RAM)
- Raspberry Pi OS (64-Bit)

**1. Install necessary modules:**
```bash
sudo ./install.sh
```

**2. Install OpenMCT:**
```bash
sudo ./install-web.sh
```

**3. Import Web GUI layout:**

If the Web GUI appears empty, import the layout from layout.json. Refer to the OpenMCT documentation for guidance.

**4. Configure camera feed:**

Edit the OpenMCT biggest frame (may display a connection error) and change the URL to http://<raspberry pi IP>:8000.

## Usage guide

**1. Start camera stream:**
```bash
./start-camera.sh
```

**2. Start Web GUI:**
```bash
./start-web.sh
```

_Ensure that this is run in a separate terminal. Do not close any terminals for the system to function properly._
