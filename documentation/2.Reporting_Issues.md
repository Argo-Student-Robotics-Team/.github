# How to properly report issues

This section describes the process of reporting issues to the Argo software team.

Each repository has a pre-made template for reporting issues.

## 2) Labels
The labels that get applied to issues in our repositories have specific meanings and are broken into two categories: status and type. An issue should only ever have one status label, but can have multiple type labels. The following isn't a complete list, but rather a list of the labels that are more universal across all of our repos.

### Status Labels:

- _**Awaiting Response**_: Waiting for a response from the contributor
- _**Discussion**_: This issue has an ongoing discussion
- _**Do Not Review**_: This issue should not be reviewed until further notice
- _**Duplicate**_: This issue already exists
- _**Help Wanted**_: This issue can be assigned to other contributors
- _**In Progress**_: This issue has ongoing work being done
- _**Invalid**_: This issue is invalid or is not relevant
- _**Investigating**_: Something in this issue/PR is being investigated
- _**Needs Review**_: This issue needs an initial or additional review
- _**On Hold**_: There is a temporary hold on any continued work or review
- _**Stale**_: This issue has been inactive for over 30 days and may be closed if inactivity continues
- _**Under Review**_ : This issue is being reviewed by at least one maintainer
- _**Won't Do**_: This issue will not be worked on

### Type Labels:

- _**Accessibility**_: Involves an accessibility feature or requires accessibility review
- _**Bug**_: Involves something that isn't working as intended
- _**Chore**_: Involves changes with no user-facing value, to the build process/internal tooling, refactors, etc.
- _**Documentation**_: Involves an update to the documentation
- _**Easy Fix**_: Involves a minor fix such as grammar, syntax, etc.
- _**Enhancement**_: Involves a new feature or enhancement request
- _**Epic**_: This issue is a larger, unnamed project with several moving parts
- _**Priority**_: This issue/PR should be resolved ASAP
