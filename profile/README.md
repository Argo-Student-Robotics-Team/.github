Argo is a student run robotics team of the [Faculty of Computing](https://raf.edu.rs/en/) (RAF), Belgrade, Serbia.
Even though we're a part of RAF, we have members from all major technical faculties in Belgrade. We have one simple goal,
and that is to make engineers. Guides for developers/users can be found under the directory [documentation/](https://github.com/Argo-Student-Robotics-Team/.github/documentation/)
